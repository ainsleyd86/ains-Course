//while()-loop - use w/BOOL like IF statement that dont
//stop executing until the condition is no longer met.

//do()-while()-loop -

//for()-loop

  /*  FOR LOOP
*In the  example we have three statements
within the for()-loop.

*The first one - int i = 0; -
is initialising the counter for the
iteration as an integer with the name i and the value 0.

*Best practice for the name of your counter variable
is to use i.

*The second statement i < 10; is our condition, and
tells Java to run the code within the for()-loop
until i is greater than or equal to 10.

*The third statement i++ is simply telling Java to
increment our counter, in this case i, by 1 after it
executes the last line of code within our for loop.

*so this example we end up printing "Hello There" 10x
